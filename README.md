# Supply_Chain_Analytics
A supply chain includes all the raw materials and parts that are made into a product and distributed up the chain for manufacture and sale.

In this project of mine I wont only categorize supply chain under the manufacturing zone, supply chain touches procurement, logistics and other corporate sectors. My focus will be more on the procurement zone. Procurement on its own is a critical component of supply chain management process. Procurement specifically refers to the process of acquiring goods & services.

That been said above, let's head right into our supply chain analytics projects.
